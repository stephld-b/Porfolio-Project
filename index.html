    <p class="center-text">After high school, I attended my local community college to study Computer Science. During the pandemic, I decided to pause schooling to work full-time as a Aquatic & Rescue Manager.</p>
    
      <p class="center-text">Upon completing 4 years of manging and growing my department, I realized my passion for web development was unwavering. So, I decided to continue my education with <em>Thinkful</em>.</p>

    <p class="center-text">As a current student at Thinkful, I am very excited to enter the next chapter of my career. </p>
